# Narrator bot for Werewolf Online Simulation
No, I will not call it Wolvesville

## Why this project?
- The day command is too messy to even maintain the code. 
- The code always clashes with othe roles
- Some errors cause the bot to crash

## Why not just fork and re-do the project?
- The day command actually can be split into many files
- For me, I will use the fork for minor changes
- The quick.db database will be restructured to use objects instead
